# About

I'm a **software developer** and **researcher** in the field of _numerical simulations_ at [FIFTY2 Technology](https://www.fifty2.eu/). In addition to my current role, I also work as a **self-employed software developer** with a strong passion for **computational science**.

## Research Background

I earned my PhD at the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Laboratory](http://e6.ijs.si/ParallelAndDistributedSystems/), part of the [Jožef Stefan Institute](http://ijs.si/). My research focused on developing the [Medusa library](http://e6.ijs.si/medusa), which is used to provide numerical solutions to Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with mesh-free methods. 

### Key Contributions
- **Efficient Solving of PDEs**: My main work involved the design and implementation of an *hp*-adaptive solution procedure for improved accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Collaborative Projects**: I participated in several applied projects utilizing the Medusa library for practical problem-solving in scientific computing.

## Freelance Software Development

As a self-employed developer, I’ve worked on a variety of projects across different industries:

- **Paraglider Design Software**: Developed software for the design and construction of paragliders, including DXF pattern export and automatic FEM mesh generation for structural analysis. This work was done for [NOVA](https://www.nova.eu/en/home/) and is proprietary.
- **Web Trading Applications**: Contributed to both the backend and frontend of web trading platforms for [Interenergo](https://www.interenergo.com/domov.html).
- **Weather Forecasting Research**: Conducted extensive research on downscaling mesoscopic forecasts to higher resolutions, resulting in a prototype implementation of CALMET's approach for [Operato](https://www.operato.eu/).
- **Excel VSTO Add-in**: Developed an Excel Add-in for measurement and quality checks of paragliders for [NOVA](https://www.nova.eu/en/home/).
