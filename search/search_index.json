The elastic deformation is modelled using the Navier-Cauchy equation. In regions where the von Mises stress exceeds the yield stress, corrections are made locally through a return mapping algorithm. We present a novel method that uses a Radial Basis Function-Finite Difference (RBF-FD) approach with Picard iteration to solve the system of nonlinear equations arising from plastic deformation. This technique eliminates the need to stabilise the divergence operator and avoids special positioning of the boundary nodes, while preserving the elegance of the meshless discretisation and avoiding the introduction of new parameters that would require tuning. The results of the proposed method are compared with analytical and Finite Element Method (FEM) solutions. The results show that the proposed method achieves comparable accuracy to FEM while offering significant advantages in the treatment of complex geometries without the need for conventional meshing or special treatment of boundary nodes or differential operators.}\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Strong form mesh-free hp-adaptive solution of linear elasticity problem</p> <p>JAN\u010cI\u010c, Mitja, KOSEC, Gregor.

Our solution procedure follows a well-established iterative solve--estimate--mark--refine paradigm. The solve phase relies on the Radial Basis Function-generated Finite Differences (RBF-FD) using point clouds generated by advancing front node positioning algorithm that supports variable node density. In the estimate phase, we introduce an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) error indicator, which assumes that the error relates to the difference between the implicitly obtained solution (from the solve phase) and a local explicit re-evaluation of the PDE at hand using a higher order approximation. Based on the IMEX error indicator, the modified Texas Three Step marking strategy is used to mark the computational nodes for h-, p- or hp-(de-)refinement. Finally, in the refine phase, nodes are repositioned and the order of the method is locally redefined using the variable order of the augmenting monomials according to the instructions from the mark phase. The performance of the introduced hp-adaptive method is first investigated on a two-dimensional Peak problem and further applied to two- and three-dimensional contact problems. We show that the proposed IMEX error indicator adequately captures the global behaviour of the error in all cases considered and that the proposed hp-adaptive solution procedure significantly outperforms the non-adaptive approach. The proposed hp-adaptive method stands for another important step towards a fully autonomous numerical method capable of solving complex problems in realistic geometries without the need for user intervention.},\n    issn     = {1435-5663},\n    doi      = {10.1007/s00366-023-01843-6},\n    url      = {https://doi.org/10.1007/s00366-023-01843-6}\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Meshless interface tracking for the simulation of dendrite envelope growth</p> <p>JAN\u010cI\u010c, Mitja, ZALO\u017dNIK, Miha, KOSEC, Gregor.

In the PFIC method, an phase-field equation is solved on a fixed mesh to track the position of the envelope. While being versatile and robust, PFIC introduces certain numerical artefacts. In this work, we present an alternative approach for the solution of the GEM that employs a Meshless (sharp) Interface Tracking (MIT) formulation, which uses direct, artefact-free interface tracking. In the MIT, the envelope (interface) is defined as a moving domain boundary and the interface-tracking nodes are boundary nodes for the diffusion problem solved in the domain. To increase the accuracy of the method for the diffusion-controlled moving-boundary problem, an h-adaptive spatial discretization is used, thus, the node spacing is refined in the vicinity of the envelope. MIT combines a parametric surface reconstruction, a mesh-free discretization of the parametric surfaces and the space enclosed by them, and a high-order approximation of the partial differential operators and of the solute concentration field using radial basis functions augmented with monomials. The proposed method is demonstrated on a two-dimensional h-adaptive solution of the diffusive growth of dendrite and evaluated by comparing the results to the PFIC approach. It is shown that MIT can reproduce the results calculated with PFIC, that it is convergent and that it can capture more details in the envelope shape than PFIC with a similar spatial discretization.}\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Some observations regarding the RBF-FD approximation accuracy dependence on stencil size</p> <p>KOLAR-PO\u017dUN, Andrej, JAN\u010cI\u010c, Mitja, ROT, Miha, KOSEC, Gregor.

Rather than covering the entire domain with scattered nodes, only regions with geometric details are covered with scattered nodes, while the rest of the domain is discretized with regular nodes. A simpler approximation can be used in regions covered by regular nodes, effectively reducing the required stencil size and computational cost compared to the approximation on scattered nodes where a set of polyharmonic splines is added to ensure convergent behaviour. This paper is an extended version of conference paper entitled \u201cSpatially-varying meshless approximation method for enhanced computational efficiency\u201d (Jan\u010di\u010d et al., 2023) presented at \u201cInternational Conference on Computational Science (ICCS) 2023\u201d. The paper is extended with discussion on development and implementation of a hybrid regular-scattered node positioning algorithm (HyNP). The performance of the proposed HyNP algorithm is analysed in terms of separation distance and maximal empty sphere radius. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that HyNP nodes can be used for solving problems from fluid flow and linear elasticity, both in 2D and 3D, using meshless methods. The extension also provides additional analyses of computational efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution obtained on the spatially-variable regularity of discretization nodes. In particular, different levels of refinement aggressiveness and scattered layer widths are considered to exploit the computational efficiency gains offered by such solution procedure.}\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Meshless adaptive solution procedure for efficient solving of partial differential equations (Doctoral Dissertation)</p> <p>JAN\u010cI\u010c, Mitja.

Focusing on Polyharmonic Spline RBFs with monomial augmentation, we observe that it affects the approximation accuracy in a particularly interesting way - the solution error oscillates under increasing stencil size. We find that we can connect this behaviour with the spatial dependence of the signed approximation error. Based on this observation we are then able to introduce a numerical quantity that indicates whether a given stencil size is locally optimal.\",\n    isbn=\"978-3-031-36027-5\"\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Spatially-varying meshless approximation method for enhanced computational efficiency</p> <p>JAN\u010cI\u010c, Mitja, ROT, Miha, KOSEC, Gregor.

Rather than covering the entire domain with scattered nodes, only regions with geometric details are covered with scattered nodes, while the rest of the domain is discretized with regular nodes. A simpler approximation using solely monomial basis can be used in regions covered by regular nodes, effectively reducing the required stencil size and computational cost compared to the approximation on scattered nodes where a set of polyharmonic splines is added to ensure convergent behaviour.\",\n    isbn=\"978-3-031-36027-5\"\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>hp-adaptive RBF-FD method</p> <p>KOSEC, Gregor, JAN\u010cI\u010c, Mitja. hp-adaptive RBF-FD method.
